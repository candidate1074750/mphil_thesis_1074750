Hello! Please find here the code files needed to reproduce the analysis and figures presented in Candidate 1074750's MPhil Thesis.

(1) aus_poverty_lines.xlsx includes the compiled Australian poverty lines from the Melbourne Institute used in this research.
(2) vf HILDA program11-longfile-release-22.R will reproduce the HILDA long file used in this analysis.
(3) vf HILDA making variables.qmd will reproduce most of the variables used in this analysis. The other necessary, new variables are created in the main analysis file.
(4) vf HILDA analysis.qmd will reproduce the main analysis on HILDA data. Two notes: (a) this is a long-ish file. If it doesn't appear automatically, there is a detailed, linked outline that can shown using the "outline" button in RStudio. (b) Nothing in this file takes super long to run, but the LMMs and the DML take the longest.
